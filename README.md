# Pulling Down the Project
1. Clone the project to your local machine
2. Create a python virtual environment using the command `python -m venv` (try 'python3 -m venv venv' if first command does not work)
3. Activate the venv (script used is machine and application dependent)
    a. Folder path to activate from should be 'CS505-Final-Project -> venv -> Scripts -> ./*use script for your system*'
    b. Ctrl+Shift+` also creates a new integrated terminal in which the virtual environment is automically activated
4. Install the requirements in the python virtual enironment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    a. Must be in main project folder (CS505-Final-Project)
5. Run the app with `flask run`
